Its purpose is the creation of technological clothing and accessories with intelligent properties. Fashion Design and Computer Sciences and Mathematics students worked together, using Raspberry Pi’s technologies, to present a functional prototype at McCord Museum’s spring event. During the Digital Spring Festival, the evening organized by Mtl Fashion Tech marked the 50th anniversary of the Expo67; the futuristic style of the projects evoked that of the 60s. The silhouette included a coat with retractable sleeves, an integrated wrist watch showing time and temperature, a camera inserted in the collar allowed the public to take photos and videos and, finally, the mittens acted as a command center, controlling the listed functions of the skidoo combinaison.",

The idea for Florilegia originates from my experience with collecting quotations. Some years ago, I began gathering excerpts and lines from novels, poetry, and occasionally from conversations and lately discovered that what I have been doing was a spiritual practice from the 5th century. Sometimes referred to as a patristic anthology, florilegium is the name of both the method and the receptacle for a collection of passages from writings of previous authors. I was disappointed when I looked for online instances of modern florilegium but found an overwhelming number of quotation apps and social media account.
